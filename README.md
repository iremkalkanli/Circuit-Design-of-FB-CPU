# FB CPU

The goal is to develop a processor design that can run 10 different operating codes written in machine language.
## Results

When the developed FBU-CPU processor meets the necessary conditions, it can execute 10 commands and perform 4 operations.</br>
As for the gains we have achieved, in order to make this processor:</br>
-We have obtained the necessary information about registers, memory, processing unit and control unit.</br>
-By examining this information in the given Von Neumann architecture, we got information about the building.</br>
-As a result, the FBU-CPU processor can properly perform the desired operations with its machine language codes.
